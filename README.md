# TOON
TOON, or Token-Oriented Object Notation, is a compact, human-readable data serialization format designed specifically for interactions with Large Language Models (LLMs). 
It encodes JSON-compatible structures like objects, arrays, and primitives in a way that reduces token usage by 30-60% compared to standard JSON, making it more efficient for AI prompts and contexts while remaining easy for humans to parse. 
Unlike JSON's verbose punctuation-heavy syntax, TOON uses YAML-like indentation for nested objects and CSV-style tabular layouts for uniform arrays of objects, minimizing redundant elements like quotes and braces
